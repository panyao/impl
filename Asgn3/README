The integration test is written in ruby.  To run, use the 'ruby' command in the terminal.  The arguments it expects are:
IntegrationTest.rb <server_dir> <client_dir> <ip_address_for_client_dir_to_hit>
Tests file creation, update, and deletion.  The <server_dir> and <client_dir> are expected to be relative paths in the current working directory that already exist
